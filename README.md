# ðŸŒ‰ CCNext Testnet Bridge Example ðŸŒ‰

This repository is designed as a starting point for users and builders alike to explore the new
Creditcoin cross-chain features brought forwards in the new `CCNext` update. Learn how to use the
Creditcoin Decentralized Oracle through a series of guided tutorials where you get to set up and
interact with your own decentralized bridge!

## Tutorials

Each tutorial is built to be as self-contained as possible. However, we still recommend you go
through them in the following order:

1. ðŸ“š [Hello Bridge]
2. ðŸ“š [Custom Contracts Bridging]
3. ðŸ“š [Bridge Offchain Worker]

## Content

Below is brief overview of each tutorial's content.

### Hello Bridge

Learn how to use the Creditcoin Decentralized Oracle from the perspective of an end user. [Hello
Bridge] makes use of pre-existing smart contracts on the Sepolia and Creditcoin Testnet so as to
minimize the amount of setup needed.

### Custom Contracts Bridging

Learn how to setup your own trustless cross-chain bridging logic by deploying your own contracts.
[Custom Contracts Bridging] teaches you the perspective of a DApp builder by showing you how to set
up custom logic across each chain you are deploying to.

### Bridge Offchain Worker

Streamline UX by automating away most transactions in the bridging process. [Bridge Offchain Worker]
shows you how offchain workers can be used to simply the user flow of your cross-chain DApp.
