# ccnext-testnet-bridge-example
This repository facilitates two examples that make use of the CCNext decentralized bridge. 

Firstly there is `hello-bridge`, an example which demonstrates bridge usage from the perspective of an end user. Hello bridge makes use of pre-existing smart contracts on Sepolia and on the CCNext Testnet so that the user only needs to worry about triggering steps of the bridging process.

Secondly, we have an example called `custom-contracts-bridging`. This is a more involved process which simulates the most basic builder experience. First we launch the contracts for our own dApp, then we trigger bridging that makes use of our new contracts.

# Usage
It is highly recommended that you complete these tutorials in order. First `hello-bridge`, then `custom-contracts-bridging`. 

To start, just navigate to each tutorial's corresponding readme. (EX: `hello-bridge/README.md`)
