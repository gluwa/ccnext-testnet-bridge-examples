# Hello Oracle
Hello bridge simulates one of the most common uses for a cross chain oracle, cross chain bridging! Each transfer has a few parts:
1. Burn ERC20 tokens in a smart contract on Sepolia
2. Trigger the CCNext oracle process to bridge tokens
3. Use the oracle outputs to mint tokens in the CCNext EVM

# Tutorial Steps

## 0. Get Script Dependencies
```sh
cd hello-oracle
yarn
```

## 1. Fund an Address on Sepolia
To make transactions on Sepolia, we first need a wallet with funds. To obtain one, follow the steps below.

### 1.1 Install a Wallet Extension
Most users use MetaMask. https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?utm_source=www.google.com 

Ensure it's configured for Sepolia:
  Click the network dropdown in MetaMask
  Choose Sepolia (or manually add it with):
    Chain ID: 11155111
    RPC: https://rpc.sepolia.org
    Currency: ETH

### 1.2 Use Sepolia Faucet
Create a new wallet on MetaMask for this proof of concept. 

!!DON'T USE A WALLET WHICH HOLDS ANY REAL ASSETS, EVEN ON A DIFFERENT NETWORK!!

Then enter your wallet address here and request Sepolia ETH 

https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia 

### 1.3 Obtain Private Key
For a later tutorial step, you will need to provide the private key of the account holding your Sepolia ETH to Anvil. 

Your private key can be found at:
MetaMask -> drop down menu -> Account Details -> Details -> Show Private Key

Save this key for later use.

## 2. Fund a CCNext Testnet Address from Faucet
TODO: Add faucet step here once faucet exists. Then replace any mention of testing key 0x45fbbc5105365822a75e09844a560445cbccf172da3087a94b5812e1871ef591

## 3. Obtain Infura API Key
The easiest way to submit transactions to Sepolia is to use Infura with your own api key.

You can get an api key by making an account with Infura (Metamask Developer) [here](https://developer.metamask.io/register)

Then you can access your api key from the dashboard [here](https://developer.metamask.io/)

## 4. Call Mint on Sepolia Contract
We need to mint ourself tokens on the previously deployed `TestERC20` contract (0x71B0e5C3C157BAe1A9080704358FBDD98194bc5A) so that we can burn them later. 

```sh
cast send --rpc-url https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/<Your Infura API Key> 0x71B0e5C3C157BAe1A9080704358FBDD98194bc5A "mint(uint256)" 50000 --private-key <private key you funded with Sepolia ETH>
```

## 5. Burn Funds on Sepolia Contract
The first step of bridging tokens is to burn those tokens on the sending chain (Sepolia). 

We burn funds by transferring them to an address for which the private key is unknown. Thereby the funds become inaccessable.

EX:
```sh
cast send --rpc-url https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/<Your Infura API Key> 0x71B0e5C3C157BAe1A9080704358FBDD98194bc5A "transfer(address, uint256)" "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001" "50" --private-key <key you funded with Sepolia ETH>
```

Save the transaction hash of your token burn transaction for later use

EX:
transactionHash         0xbc1aefc42f7bc5897e7693e815831729dc401877df182b137ab3bf06edeaf0e1

## 6. Submit Bridging Query to CCNext Prover
Now that we've burnt funds on Sepolia, we need to make proof of that token burn available on the CCNext Testnet. We do so by creating a "bridging query".

TODO: Replace this well known testing key with instructions to use testnet faucet and fund an address
```sh
yarn submit_query \
https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/<your_infura_api_key> \
<transaction_hash_from_step_5> \
<private_key_of_address_from_step_2>
```

Proving should take ~8 minutes and no more than 30 minutes.

Once the proving process completes, save the QueryId printed for later:

EX:
Query Proving completed. QueryId: 0x7ee33a2be05c9019dedcd833c9c2fa516c2bd316b225dd7ca3bde5b1cdb987db

## 7. Use Oracle Provisioned Data to Mint Tokens on CCNext Testnet
TODO: pre-fill the prover contract address, bridge contract address, and Mintable contract addresses once we have final addresses on testnet.

We need to call `uscBridgeCompleteMint` in the pre-existing bridge contract at address 0xB85f7EFC53246468693d993558c36Be284FE8995 on CCNext Testnet. 

Finally, we provide the QueryId we saved in step 6.

```sh
yarn complete_mint.js \
<private_key_of_address_from_step_2> \
<bridge_contract_address> \
<prover_address> \
<query_id> \
<mintable_contract_address>
```

## 8. Check Balance in CCNext Test ERC20 Contract
As a final check, we take a look at the balance in our account within the ERC20 contract where we minted our tokens.

Again, that contract lives at address 0xF87960561ac3331f3492523fEf5F6096A460A413 on CCNext Testnet

```sh
yarn check_balance \
<mintable_contract_address> \
<your_account_address_from_sepolia>
```

You should see a result like:
ðŸ“¦ Token: Mintable (MNT)
ðŸ§¾ Raw Balance: 50
ðŸ’° Formatted Balance: 0.00000000000000005 MNT

# Conclusion
Congratulations! You've bridged your first funds using the CCNext Decentralized oracle. This is only one simple example of the cross chain functionality made possible by the novel CCNext oracle. 

The next tutorial will add an additional piece of the puzzle, self hosted smart contracts! In production, the CCNext oracle will almost always be used by teams of DApp builders who will conduct bridging on behalf of their end users. Such teams will want to define and deploy their own contracts as shown next in the `custom-contracts-bridging` tutorial.
