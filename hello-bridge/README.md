# Hello Bridge

This tutorial introduces you to one of the most common uses for a cross chain oracle, **cross chain
bridging!** Cross-chain bridging on Creditcoin can be broken down into three broad steps:

1. To being, the `ERC20` tokens to bridge are burned using a smart contract on our _source chain_
   (in this case, Sepolia).
2. Then, we query the Creditcoin decentralized oracle for a _proof_ of our source chain token burn.
3. Finally, using the resulting proof from [step 2], we mint the same amount of tokens on Creditcoin
   (in this case, Creditcoin testnet).

## External dependencies

To continue with this tutorial, you will first need to have the following dependencies available
locally:

- [yarn]
- [foundry]

> [!TIP]
> This project provides a `flake.nix` you can use to download all the dependencies you will need for
> this tutorial inside of a sandboxed environment. Just keep in mind you will have to
> **[enable flakes]** for this to work. To start you development environment, simply run:
>
> ```bash
> nix develop
> ```

Once you have all your dependencies setup, you will need to download some packages with `yarn`:

```bash
cd hello-bridge
foundryup --version v1.2.3 # Skip this command if you are using nix!
yarn
```

## 1. Setup

This tutorial involves the use of two different blockchains. 

- Sepolia, which serves as our _source chain_ for the tutorial. This is where tokens are burned.
- Creditcoin USC Testnet, which serves as our _execution chain_ for the tutorial. This is where 
  oracle queries are processed and where tokens are minted.

In order to use both blockchains we need to create a wallet and fund it with the native tokens of 
both networks.

### 1.1 Generate a New Wallet Address

In order to safely sign transactions for this tutorial, we want to generate a fresh EVM wallet address.
Since all EVM networks use the same address and transaction signature scheme we can use the address we 
create on both Sepolia and Creditcoin USC Testnet.

> [!CAUTION]
> In this tutorial, we will be using your wallet's private key to allow some test scripts to act on
> your wallet's behalf. Make sure the wallet you use contains nothing of value. Ideally it should be
> a newly created address.

Generating our new wallet is simple! Just run the following command:
```bash
cast wallet new
```

Save the resulting wallet address and private key for future use. They should look like:
```bash
Address:     0xBE7959cA1b19e159D8C0649860793dDcd125a2D5
Private key: 0xb9c179ed56514accb60c23a862194fa2a6db8bdeb815d16e2c21aa4d7dc2845d
```

### 1.2 Get some test funds (`Sepolia`)

Now that you have your new test address ready, you will be needing some funds to make transactions.
You can request some Sepolia ETH tokens using a [ðŸš° testnet faucet]. We link to the Google sepolia
faucet here.

### 1.3 Get some test funds (`Creditcoin`)

You will also need to fund your account on the Creditcoin Testnet, otherwise our oracle query
submission will fail due to lack of funds. Head to the [ðŸš° creditcoin discord faucet] to request
some test tokens there.

Your request for tokens in the Discord faucet should look like this. Substitute in your testnet
account address from [step 1.1]:

```bash
/faucet address: 0xBE7959cA1b19e159D8C0649860793dDcd125a2D5
```

Note, that currently the faucet yields 100 test CTC every 24 hours. This balance is sufficient
to submit 9 oracle queries, since testnet oracle fees are artificially high to prevent DOS.

Now that your wallet is ready to make transactions on both networks, you will be needing a way 
to interact with it from the command line.

### 1.4 Obtaining an Infura API key

Finally, you will need a way to send requests to the Sepolia test chain. The easiest way to do this
is to sign up with an _RPC provider_. [Infura] will work for testing purposes.

Follow the onscreen instructions to create your account and generate your first api key. Make sure
you are requesting a Sepolia API key. Copy it: you will be needing it in the following steps. You
are now ready to go with the rest of the tutorial!

## 2. Minting some tokens on Sepolia

More tokens? But I thought I had all the tokens I needed! Well, kind of. For our example we
demonstrate burning ERC20 tokens rather than sepolia native tokens. Making an ERC20 contract call
to burn tokens and emitting a token burn event better demonstrates the best practice way of using
the Creditcoin Oracle described in our [DApp Design Patterns] Gitbook page.

But your new Sepolia account doesn't have these tokens yet!

For your convenience, we have [already deployed] a test `ERC20` contract to Sepolia which you can
use to mint some dummy ERC20 tokens. Run the following command:

```bash
cast send --rpc-url https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/<Your Infura API key> \
    0x15166Ba9d24aBfa477C0c88dD1E6321297214eC8                         \
    "mint(uint256)" 50000000000000000000                               \
    --private-key <Your wallet private key>
```

## 3. Burning the tokens you want to bridge

The first step in bridging tokens is to burn them on the _source chain_ (Sepolia in this case). We
burn tokens by transferring them to an address for which the private key is unknown, making them
inaccessible. This way, when creating the same amount of tokens on Creditcoin at the end of the
bridging process, we won't be creating any artificial value. Run the following command:

```bash
cast send --rpc-url https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/<Your Infura API key> \
    0x15166Ba9d24aBfa477C0c88dD1E6321297214eC8                         \
    "burn(uint256)" 50000000000000000000                               \
    --private-key <Your wallet private key>
```

This should display some output stating that your transaction was a success, along with a
transaction hash:

```bash
transactionHash         0xbc1aefc42f7bc5897e7693e815831729dc401877df182b137ab3bf06edeaf0e1
```

Save the transaction hash. You will be needing it in the next step.

## 4. Get a proof of the token burn from the Creditcoin Oracle

Great, we've burned some tokens! But how can we prove it? Most cross-chain bridges rely on a
_centralized_, _trusted_ approach: one service or company handles all the token burns on the _source
chain_ and is responsible for distributing the same amount of tokens on the target chain. This can
be an issue, since nothing is preventing that company from censoring certain transactions or even
stealing funds! Web3 was made to be _trustless_ and _decentralized_, let's make it that way ðŸ˜Ž.

Now that we've burnt funds on Sepolia, we need to create a proof of that token burn using the
Creditcoin Decentralized Oracle. We do this by submitting an _oracle query_. Run the following
command:

```bash
yarn submit_query                                      \
    https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/<Your infura API key> \
    <Transaction hash from step 3>                     \
    <Your wallet private key>
```

> [!TIP]
> This will take a while. Sit back, relax, and wait for the query to process â˜• Proving should take
> ~16 minutes and no more than 30 minutes.

Once the proving process completes, you should see some output stating that your query was proven
successfully, along with a query id:

```bash
Query Proving completed. QueryId: 0x7ee33a2be05c9019dedcd833c9c2fa516c2bd316b225dd7ca3bde5b1cdb987db
```

Save the query id. You will be needing it in the next step.

## 5. Mint Tokens on Creditcoin

Now that we have a proof of the token burn on our _source chain_, we can finalize the bridging
process by minting the same amount of tokens on the Creditcoin testnet. To do that, we need to call
a [bridge contract] on Creditcoin which will interpret the data of our proof from [step 4]. We have
already deployed this contract for you, since in this tutorial you're acting as an end user. But
normally each DApp team would customize and deploy their own USC.

As we complete the minting process, we're minting tokens in an [ERC20 contract] which mirrors the test token
contract we deployed on Sepolia. This contract is already deployed on creditcoin usc testnet.

Run the following command to query the bridge contract:

```bash
yarn complete_mint                             \
    <Your wallet private key>                  \
    0x441726D6821B2009147F0FA96E1Ee09D412cCb38 \
    0xc43402c66e88f38a5aa6e35113b310e1c19571d4 \
    <Query Id from step 4>                     \
    0xb0fb0b182f774266b1c7183535A41D69255937a3
```

Congratulations, you've just made your first _trutsless bridge transaction_ using the Creditcoin
Decentralized Oracle!

## 6. Check Balance in USC Testnet ERC20 Contract

As a final check, we can take a look at the balance of your account on Creditcoin to confirm that
the bridging process was successful.

Run the following command to query the contract:

```bash
yarn check_balance                             \
    0xb0fb0b182f774266b1c7183535A41D69255937a3 \
    <Your wallet address>
```

You should get some output showing your wallet's balance on Creditcoin:

```bash
ðŸ“¦ Token: Mintable (TEST)
ðŸ§¾ Raw Balance: 50000000000000000000
ðŸ’° Formatted Balance: 50.0 TEST
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you've bridged your first funds using the **Creditcoin Decentralized oracle!** This
is only a simple example of the cross chain functionality made possible by Creditcoin, keep on
reading to find more ways in which you can leverage decentralized cross-chain proofs of state!

In the next tutorial we will be looking at the next piece in the puzzle of decentralized bridging:
self-hosted smart contracts! In a production environment, the Creditcoin oracle will almost always
be used by teams of DApp builders who will handle data provisioning on behalf of their end users.
Such teams will want to define and deploy their own contracts as shown in the [custom contract
bridging] tutorial.
